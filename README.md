# elm-wai-aria-tabs

This package offers an implementation of the [Tabs
widget](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel) as specified in
the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices
1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/).  Take a look at the [demo
page](https://kirchner.github.io/elm-wai-aria-tabs/).

See more end-to-end example code in the `examples/` folder.


## Design Goals

- Stick to the WAI-ARIA guideline as close as possible.
- Offer a simple version for the standard [elm/html
  Package](https://packages.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/html/latest/).
- Make the widget customizable for any other UI library, e.g.
  [rtfeldman/elm-css](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rtfeldman/elm-css/latest/)
  or
  [mdgriffith/elm-ui](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/).


## Overview

The minimal code to get working tabs with automatic activation would be
something like this:

```elm
TODO
```


## Usage

Add [the kirchner/elm-wai-aria-tabs Elm
package](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/kirchner/elm-wai-aria-tabs/latest/)
as a dependency by running

```
$ elm install kirchner/elm-wai-aria-tabs
```
